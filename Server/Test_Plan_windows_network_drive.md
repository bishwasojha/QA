# WND2 implementation

Basic expected setup
------------

windows machine
* [x] AD installed      -> fsweb.test
* [x] SMB2 share accessible (SMB should also work)
* [x] Service account -> any user with read access to the whole target SMB share should do. -> serviceuser(ro), serviceadmin(rw)

ownCloud
* [x] user_ldap connected to the windows' AD    -> docker image oc107_wnd220rc1_ldap
* [x] WND2 (collaborative) mount:
  * [x] authentication: "login credentials, saved in DB" or "user entered, saved in DB"
  * [x] configuration: connected to the windows machine. Service account matching the one in the windows machine
  * [x] wnd:listen running with serviceuser
  * [x] read all User0X subfolder, but not write: `smbclient //fsweb.test.owncloud.com/share -U serviceuser`
  * [x] WND(collaborative) "Login Credentials, Saved in DB", 172.16.142.10, share, $user, , serviceuser, ...
         turns green (or yellow when owncloud admin does not exist in windows.)


Things to test
-------------
* [x] User04 and user 05 can read/write files in their shares.
* [ ] 1. `occ wnd:set-service-account` command encrypts the password without disrupting the mount (users can access to the mount normally) -> #336
* [ ] 2. oc_filecache table will only register the storage for the service account independently of the users accessing to it -> #337
* [x] 3. any file access by the users will use their own accounts (based on the authentication method) -> #338
    * [x] 1. if a user doesn't have read permission over a file in the windows machine, that user shouldn't be able to see the file listed
    * [x] 2. if a user who doesn't have read permission over a file see the file listed (could happen due to desync*), the user will receive an error trying to open the file
    * [x] 3. if a user doesn't have write permission over a file, the user will see the file but will get an error when he tries to write it
    * [x] 4. ownCloud's permissions will reflect the windows' file attributes, but not the ACLs for a specific user
* [ ] 4. Password reset feature (when the password changes in windows) must work
    * [ ] 1. for the service account, it must work regardless of the wnd authentication (in the mount config)
    * [ ] 2. for specific auth methods, "login credentials, saved in DB" won't work (not implemented), and "user entered, saved in DB" must work
    * [ ] 3. "username and password" and "global credentials" should also be reset if applicable
    * [ ] 4. password reset feature must work across WND and WND2 storages. This means that if a WND triggers a password reset, WND2 storages will also be affected (if applicable), and viceversa
* [x] 5. wnd listener must work and must update the filecache info without issues
    * [ ] 1. process-queue should also be "affected" by the password reset feature
* [ ] 6. memcache will be used (not tested if it isn't available) using a ttl of 30 minutes by default. It's possible to disable by setting a negative number in the config.php file (config key in the readme file)
    * [ ] 1. we'll cache things by oc storage, which using the basic expected setup would be almost the same as cache per user.

(*) desync could happen because changing permissions in the windows machine won't trigger a change in the mtime, so the change won't be visible to ownCloud


Additional setups
------------

Along with the basic setup:

ownCloud:
* [ ] guests app installed
* [ ] WND2 (collaborative) mount:
  * [ ] authentication: "username and password"
  * [ ] configuration: connected to the windows machine. Service account matching the one in the windows machine
  * [ ] applicable: guests group

This will allow guests users to access to the windows machine using all of them the same account (probably more restricted)
The same expectations explained in the "things to test" are applied in this case.


Notes
-------

* Password reset feature applies only to "user entered, saved in DB", "username and password" and "global credentials", as well as the service account. The rest of the auths won't reset the password
* As said, password reset feature works across WND and WND2 mounts.
* Using any auth for the WND2 implementation should work, although there might not be a real use case for them.
* Permissions:
  * We'll use only the windows' file attributes as ownCloud permissions. This should cause less problems in ownCloud because the ownCloud permissions will be the same for the service account and the user
  * ACLs won't be taken into account. In practice, this means that the user is allowed to upload files and windows will return an error if he hasn't enough permissions to do so.
