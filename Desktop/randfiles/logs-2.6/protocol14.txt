client grows to 305 MB during discovery
 - the first 260 MB are reached fast, then it takes several minutes to reach 300 MB. 
 - A constant disk IO of 4..5 MB/s is seen in taskmanager.
 - 'Aborted' is printed in red, the size falls back to 26 MB, then the process repeats.

Nothing is ever upladed to the server.

TODO: Retry with local copy inside the VM (not mounted...)
